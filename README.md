## Introduction
Notes on the principles of neurosurgical science for the MRCS exam. These aim to bridge the gap between undergraduate neuroanatomy and the higher-level, more integrated knowledge expected for the MRCS exam.

## Structure
The notes are organised into six modules with the following structure:
- Organisation of the nervous system
- Neurovascular anatomy and stroke
- Cerebrospinal fluid circulation and management of intracranial pressure
- Anterior and middle cranial fossae
- Posterior cranial fossa and venous sinuses
- Spinal anatomy and spinal cord injury

## Implementation
Individual sections are written in Jupyter notebooks. These are then joined together and compiled as a Jupyter book. The compiled documents are then hosted online as HTML files for access through a browser.
